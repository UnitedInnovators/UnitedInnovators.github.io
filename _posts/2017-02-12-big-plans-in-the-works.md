## We are holding our very own summit! Repeat, We are holding our very own summit!

We have a summit for mid April in the works and as we have been working on it, we thought it might be a good idea to share some of our progress so far with you. As of right now, the plan is to divide into groups with each one focusing on a specific letter of STEM. This way, we can play to every attendee's interests while we aim to inspire and empower them to pursue their interest in STEM.

We can't tell you exactly what we have planned because we are still hammering out a lot of details (we don't even know the exact date yet), but here is the list of pretty awesome workshop ideas we have been looking into:

- Building real prosthetic hands from 3d printed parts!
- Assembling your very own personalized circuit!
- Some Game Theory / Computer Science gladiator style competitions!
- Design Thinking / Rapid Prototyping challenges!
- A pinewood derby!
- And way too many more to list!

What do you think? Are you as excited as we are to see some of these in action? Comments? Suggestions? Criticism?
As always, if you want to contact us, just drop us a line. There is a fancy email form on the website.
