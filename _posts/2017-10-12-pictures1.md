Sorry for taking so long, but at last we come bearings gifts in the form of pictures for our loyal followers. These are the majority of the pictures we have taken over the past year, and even some from the summer (namely our partnership with HPNC).

<div class="slider autoplay">
    {% for image in site.static_files %}
		{% if image.path contains 'images/slideshow' %}
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="image" />
		{% endif %}
	{% endfor %}
  </div>
  {% include slick.html %}
